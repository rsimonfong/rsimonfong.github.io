excerpt: 'Our work proposes a novel method which enables available quantum-inspired QUBO solvers to solve hard 3-SAT problems, matching the accuracy the current state-of-the-art algorithmic framework for solving 3-SAT problems. Therefore, establishing QUBO solvers (such as quantum annealers) as an alternative paradigm for hard 3-SAT problems. We provide both the theoretical proof of the validity of the method and numerical simulations (open sourced along with the paper) supporting our claims.'

Boolean satisfiability (SAT) is a propositional logic problem of determining whether an assignment of variables satisfies a Boolean formula. Many combinatorial optimization problems can be formulated in Boolean SAT logic -- either as k-SAT decision problems or Max k-SAT optimization problems, with conflict-driven (CDCL) solvers being the most prominent. Despite their ability to handle large instances, CDCL-based solvers have fundamental scalability limitations. In light of this, we propose recently-developed quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) solvers as an alternative platform for 3-SAT problems. To utilize them, we implement a 2-step [3-SAT]-[Max 2-SAT]-[QUBO] conversion procedure and present a rigorous proof to explicitly calculate the number of both satisfied and violated clauses of the original 3-SAT instance from the transformed Max 2-SAT formulation. We then demonstrate, through numerical simulations on several benchmark instances, that digital QUBO solvers can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on 78-variable 3-SAT benchmark problems. Our work facilitates the broader use of quantum annealers on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, as well as their quantum-inspired digital counterparts, for solving 3-SAT problems.[LINK](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03757)
