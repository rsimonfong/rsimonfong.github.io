Research
======
My research focuses on bridging the theoretical and applied aspects of optimization methods,
dynamical systems, information theory and geometry.

Keywords: Optimization, Information Geometry, Differential Geometry, Reservoir Computing

Background & History
======
I received my Ph.D. from the [University of Birmingham](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk). Prior to that I received my M.Math and B.Math from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca) in the Computational Mathematics and (Hon. ) Pure Mathematics program respectively. Upon receiving my Ph.D., I was employed as a Researcher at Noah's Ark Lab of Huawei and then a Senior Researcher in the Theory Lab of Huawei.
