Hello, I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [International Research Center for Neurointelligence (WPI-IRCN)](https://ircn.jp/en/) of [The University of Tokyo Institutes for Advanced Study](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/academics/todias.html), JP.

Research
======

My research aims to derive practical approaches from first principles with
mathematical rigor.

<b>Research Focus:</b> My work bridges theoretical fields: dynamical systems, information theory, and geometry -- with applied domains such as machine learning and optimization.

<b>Research Work:</b> broadly categorized into two interconnected areas:
<ol>
<li> Geometry, Information theory and Manifold Optimization </li>
<li> Reservoir Computing: Universality, Operator Algebra, and Kernel Machines </li>
</ol>
<!-- My research focuses on bridging the theoretical and applied aspects of optimization methods,
dynamical systems, information theory and geometry. -->

Keywords: Optimization, Information Geometry, Differential Geometry, Reservoir Computing

Background & History
======
I was trained as both a pure mathematician and a computer scientist.

I received my Ph.D. from the [University of Birmingham](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk) under the supervision of [Peter Tino](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pxt/) and [Joshua Knowles](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~jdk/). Prior to that I was at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca), where I completed my M.Math in Computational Mathematics under the supervision of the late [Thomas Coleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_F._Coleman) and received a B.Math (Honors) in Pure Mathematics. 

After receiving my Ph.D., I alternated between academia and industry, serving as a Researcher at Huawei's Noah's Ark Lab and later as a Senior Researcher in Huawei's Theory Lab. I also held a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at the University of Birmingham with [Peter Tino](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pxt/).
