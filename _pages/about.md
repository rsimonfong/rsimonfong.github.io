Hello, I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [School of Computer Science](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/computer-science) of [University of Birmingham](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk), UK. 

Research
======
My research focuses on bridging the theoretical and applied aspects of optimization methods,
dynamical systems, information theory and geometry.

Keywords: Optimization, Information Geometry, Differential Geometry, Reservoir Computing

Background & History
======
I received my Ph.D. from the [University of Birmingham](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk) under the supervision of [Peter Tino](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pxt/) and [Joshua Knowles](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~jdk/). Prior to that I was at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca), where I completed my M.Math in Computational Mathematics under the supervision of the late [Thomas Coleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_F._Coleman) and received a B.Math (Honors) in Pure Mathematics. After receiving my Ph.D., I spent a few years in the industry before returning to the University of Birmingham. I first worked as a Researcher at Huawei's Noah's Ark Lab and later as a Senior Researcher in the Theory Lab at Huawei.
